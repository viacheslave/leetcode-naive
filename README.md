# LeetCode solutions

## Description

My personal `leetcode` solutions to some of the problems.
Mostly `C#`. Some problems are in `Java`, `SQL` and `bash`.

## Note
This is for fun.
I don't spend much time on a problem, so the solutions often are not optimized, code style is not consistent.
Solution should just work and pass tests.
