# Some  LeetCode solutions

## Description

My personal `leetcode` solutions to some of the problems.

Mostly `C#`. 

Some problems are in `Java`, `SQL` and `bash`.

## Note
This is fun.

I don't spend much time on problems, so the solutions are far from optimized, coded in weak and inconsistent way.

Solutions should just work and pass tests.
